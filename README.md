# docker-pyngmm

Docker container for Python-based development of non-ergodic ground motion models.

## Quick start

Start with `make run`. Visiting `http://<hostname>:10000/?token=<token>` in a
browser loads JupyterLab, where hostname is the name of the computer running
docker and token is the secret token printed in the console.

See [Jupter Docker Stacks](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks) for more information.
